# PortSelf
- This website i created was with a mindset that i would introduce myself and all but it would have been way too boring so i changed it to introductory website of my life and the part of it.
- Actually one could say that i do not have people to talk to (lie i do have it is just that i do not like to talk much.....but i can write )
- So this is actually a very simple website i created with different headings and i chose the theme to be blue aesthetic.
- And this was way too fun as i also went through all my gallery for the photos of my rabbit and actually found some very cool ones.

# What I Learned
- Patience is the key while making a very annoying website.
- The thing which i hate was that the whole website was having similar code for each topic so if i had to change one then i had to change all. (So it was a nice exercise for my fingers and ctrl c and v buttons)
- I also learned that if you want to add something new or fix a problem before code which has already been committed then the code disappears as one writes.....COOL!! DO you know how much time it consumed....ruined my mental state for real.
- Also my mother keeps telling me to study so Why not study and create the website of the stuff i learned as topics!!!!
(COOL COOL)


# Problem in site
- Ok for some reason the font style i chose for the heading is not working on brave but was working when i opened it through vs code on Chrome or seperately opening it on Chrome through the playable link So i would advice you to review using chrome? ig it is alright if not.
