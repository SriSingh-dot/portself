    <h2>Who Even Am I?</h2>

    <img src="port3.jpg" alt="Cute photo" class="right-img">
    <p>I am currently sixteen years old and will be turning seventeen this year. My real name is Srishti but I go by Sri on online platforms most of the time. I am a student and have a keen interest in history, art, and coding (still chose the non-medical stream for some reason). I am a very extroverted person and love animals very much. I personally dislike people who try to act dominant over others or look superior to them. I am an Indian and can speak Hindi, Maithili, Bhojpuri, English, and the most enchanting language of all, Sanskrit. Well in school years I first used to study French but later changed my language choice to Sanskrit (no hate, actually French was a language my mother could not teach). And yes I am a big foodie and love to eat all kinds of food, but I would appreciate chicken more. I follow Hinduism and believe in all the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. But you know every person has that one god they love the most and for me it's Lord Shiva (The Destroyer God).</p>

    <img src="port4.jpg" alt="Cute Photo" class="right-img">
    <p>My hobbies include reading online books, watching anime and dramas, listening to music, and coding. I also love to travel and explore new places. I am a person who does not like to talk nonsense for no reason, but I also wanted someone to talk to so I adopted a pet rabbit named Chicku. He is just so lovely and cute. My special skills are actually sports like badminton, tennis, and football. I also have played district matches in athletics, state matches in javelin, shot put, and discus throw. In 2021 I also won a gold medal in National level Karate championship of the form Taiyo Kai Shito Ryu. But sadly could not participate in the International Level because of COVID as well as you know I was not old enough to travel alone at that time, and my parents were not ready to let me go alone.</p>

  <h2>My Art Talent</h2>

  <img src="port5.jpg" alt="Art Photo Madubani" class="right-img">
  <p>I think that art is what i inherited from my mother.Not trying to show off but my mother used to be a fashion designer and a professional madhubani art artist.
    The sad thing is that we (me and her brother) held her back from her dreams and eventually she gave up that job to take care of us.
    I will not say that i am creative.....it's probably that i am just good at copying things.Like i do not rememeber a thing i made from my imagination and it came out successful.
    I HAtE WatEr CoLoRs.... in starting i do everything perfectly but then i get impatient and Ruin the sh*t out of my painting.
  </p><img src="port6.jpg" alt="Modern Art Photo" class="right-img">
<p>But i do like sketching and shading things and i think that i am pretty good and actually patient in those kinds of drawings.
The two paintings which are displayed are actually made by me (source- got inspiration from pinterest)
 The one above is Madhubani painting originated originally from India from a small village in Bihar.
 Madhubani originally was painted only on gods.
 The painting below is a modern art consiting of proper straight lines and perfect proportions.
 Do tell me how it looks!!!
Also tell me which type of art you like the most.

<p>Now do i believe that there is Art hidden everywhere? Certainly yes, I do actually believe that if one look with no other distraction and look around them clearly,
   one can find art in the most unexpected places.

  <h2>School Life</h2>

  <img src="port7.jpg" alt="School Photo 1" class="right-img">
  <p>Do I like school???</p>

  <p>Bro! Not at all. I hate the fact that I have to wake up so early in the morning, like 5:00 am, and get ready for that stupid school. I hate that we have to wear those ugly uniforms, follow so many rules, and stay seated for 7 hours straight. Like seriously, who thought of this stupid idea of school? We only get a 40-minute period of games in a week and another 40-minute period of art in a week. What are we??? Robots???</p>

  <p>Nevermind. The best thing about school is meeting my friends and bunking classes with them. Well, we do get caught easily, as other students cannot mind their own business. The teachers always show favoritism and only favor students who are already good in studies. Do we exist? Are we invisible? Or are we just too dumb to understand?</p>

  <img src="port8.jpg" alt="School Photo 2" class="right-img">
  <p>Maybe I am being way too dramatic.</p>

  <p>Why don't you try visiting my school once? I bet you will feel better being in a cell than this stupid school. Just kidding! I do have some good memories in school, like Annual Functions, Diwali Mela, and also, I do not know how much our school earned that year, but Sunil Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan were the chief guests for our annual function. I am not even joking — THE LITERAL RICHEST BOLLYWOOD ACTORS WERE THE CHIEF GUESTS. I guess schools do actually do good things sometimes.</p>
